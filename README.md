# GeoVis
Global climate datasets, whether from satellite observations or from models, are often enormous in scope and thus challenging to visualize in effective ways. This is especially true in popular scientific presentations and in teaching situations where strong visual ‘effects’ are increasingly expected by the public. This tool serves as an aid to researchers for communicating science through effective visuals.
